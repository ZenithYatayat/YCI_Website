                For the supply chain to be effective in a multichannel operation, it is necessary
                for management to meet three milestones:
                <br />
                <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>Increased efficiency </li>
                    <li>Improved customer service </li>
                    <li>Building relationships </li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                Each of these goals includes definitive and specific objectives required within
                an operation. Fortunately, YCI follows proven best practices to achieve those objectives.

                To increase efficiency, YCI has developed cost-effective transportation rates while
                reducing overhead, total inventory, and overall cost-per-order processing. We have
                improved our warehouse operations, including processes, layout, and flow, by working
                closely with our team. Established a two-way relationship and frequently share best
                practices, issues, and opportunities.
                <br />
                <br />
                To improve logistical efficiencies, YCI improved value-added services such as packaging,
                marking, and quality inspections. This improves the chance of errors being caught
                at the source; source-based services speed product flow through the warehouse.

                    In direct marketing enterprises, fulfillment operations are in partnership with
                    marketing and merchandising. This partnership is like a three-legged stool — without
                    all three legs the stool cannot stand. Fulfillment operations’ inbound and outbound
                    transportation is key to delivering marketing’s promise to the customer to get the
                    shipment delivered on time and in good condition. YCI is available for such jobs.

                    True two-way collaboration between retailer and carrier is key to the success of
                    logistics execution. Measures of success are total cost, time in transit, and responsiveness
                    of the carrier representative. In this association YCI plays wonderful job as carrier.
