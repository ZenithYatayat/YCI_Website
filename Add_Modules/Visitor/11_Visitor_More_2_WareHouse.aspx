                    As the name Suggest this is most advanced model which is a collaborative, multi-tier
                    logistics platform for visibility across all freight transactions, providing a single
                    version of the truth for both the partier. (Company and the Service Provider)
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It is a model whereby rates are derived based on the market dynamics whereby a profit
                    % on cost is fixed initially.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    So in this model when we are assured about the profit % and when entire responsibility
                    of placing the vehicles is on single transporter, Dual benefits can be taken of
                    –
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Commanding of Rates –Now in the value chain whereby previously driver and owners
                    were commanding the rates and it was coming onto us, now transporter will command
                    the rates and whereby most efficient/ transparent/ best costing can be achieved.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Transporter Management Principle of Authority with Responsibility – When a single
                    person is authorized to clear all the indents well on time automatically he is made
                    responsible.
